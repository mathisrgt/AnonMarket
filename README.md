</h4>

üß™A lending multi-chain platform which enables cross-chain interactions between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana.

## The project

AnonMarket is a decentralized predictive market platform where users can bet on real-world outcomes, such as Bitcoin's price in two months or the next U.S. president. The platform prioritizes user privacy through Alice ring signatures, ensuring complete anonymity in voting while maintaining blockchain transparency. AnonMarket leverages Chainlink and Pyth oracles for accurate and unbiased event resolutions, ensuring reliable outcomes.

The platform integrates Web3Auth for seamless account abstraction and wallet functionality, making it user-friendly for blockchain newcomers. Worldcoin‚Äôs World ID provides decentralized identity verification, enhancing trust and security. USDC, managed via Circle, is used for transactions, offering stable and widely recognized currency support. To ensure cross-chain functionality, Fusion+ from 1Inch bridges funds efficiently between blockchains.

AnonMarket combines advanced blockchain technology, strong privacy measures, and seamless user experiences to redefine predictive markets for a global audience.

üñãÔ∏è Intro to Ring Signatures
Ring Signatures are cryptographic protocols that enable a group of users to sign a message while preserving the anonymity of the actual signer. Unlike traditional digital signatures, ring signatures introduce signer ambiguity, making it unclear which member of the group produced the signature. This ensures that the message could plausibly have been signed by any participant, making it extremely difficult to trace the true author.
Ring signatures enhance privacy by making transactions untraceable. They are widely used in applications such as blockchain-based privacy coins (e.g., Monero) and secure voting systems, where anonymity and security are paramount.

Compared to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZK), ring signatures stand out for their simplicity and efficiency. While FHE involves heavy computations to process encrypted data and ZK often feels like a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù to developers, ring signatures are lightweight and straightforward. They provide anonymity by masking the signer‚Äôs identity while ensuring message authenticity, making them ideal for use cases like anonymous payments or secure voting systems.

AnonMarket is built using a combination of cutting-edge blockchain technologies and privacy-preserving mechanisms. At its core, the platform employs ring signatures to ensure that votes remain entirely anonymous, adding a unique layer of privacy not commonly found in predictive markets.

For backend operations, we use a smart contract architecture deployed on Ethereum, ensuring transparency and immutability. Chainlink and Pyth are integrated as oracles to fetch and validate data from external sources, providing reliable and unbiased event resolutions. To support seamless user onboarding and wallet functionality, we utilize Web3Auth for account abstraction, making the platform accessible even to users unfamiliar with blockchain wallets.

World‚Äôs World ID is implemented for decentralized identity verification, ensuring user legitimacy without compromising privacy. Transactions on the platform are conducted using USDC, leveraging Circle for stablecoin payments. Additionally, to enhance cross-chain operability, we incorporate Fusion+ from 1Inch to facilitate efficient fund transfers across multiple blockchains.

The frontend is designed for simplicity and speed, built using React with state management handled by Redux. This ensures a responsive and intuitive user experience. During development, we faced challenges in optimizing gas usage for the smart contracts, and a notable hack involved customizing the smart contract to batch process multiple transactions to reduce costs. By combining these technologies and strategies, AnonMarket delivers a robust, private, and user-friendly predictive market platform.
