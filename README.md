## 🔎 **What Are Ring Signatures?**  

Ring signatures are at the heart of AnonMarket’s privacy features.  

### 🧠 **How They Work**  
A **ring signature** allows a user to sign a transaction within a group while keeping their identity anonymous.  
- **Ambiguity**: It’s impossible to trace the exact signer, enhancing privacy.  
- **Untraceable Transactions**: Widely used in **privacy coins** (e.g., Monero) and **secure voting systems**.  

### 🤔 **Why Ring Signatures?**  
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to computationally intense alternatives like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).  
- **Transparency**: Unlike Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK), which can be opaque to developers, ring signatures are simple and accessible.  
- **Applications**: Ideal for **anonymous payments**, **secure voting systems**, and **predictive markets** like AnonMarket.
